# Govini-Project
This project was for a technical interview response. 

My findings: I normalized the data and found that most of the money spent was on the stryker proogram. However it wasn't clear from the data which rows are related to the Abrams tank. "M1A1" in the title column (and nowhere else), but there are only a few rows that have either M1A1, M2A1, or M1130. Basically the numbers of rows are too insignificant to answer their intial question. I would need to ask Govini if those were all the rows that we needed? If they say yes, then I would add up the award amounts. If they say no, then I would have to ask how to know what data is associated with M1A1. Then from there I would easily give them the correct award amounts.

# Govini-Project
This project was for a technical interview response. 

My findings: It's not clear from the data which rows are related to the Abrams tank. For example, I see "M1A1" in the title column (and nowhere else), but there are only a few rows that have either M1A1, M2A1, or M1130. I would need to ask Govini if those were all the rows that we needed? If they say yes, then I would add up the award amounts. If they say no, then I would have to ask how to know what data is associated with M1A1.

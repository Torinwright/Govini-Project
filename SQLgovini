Start the db and create a db file called foo.db
sqlite3 foo.db

Import the data into a new table called original inside the db
.mode csv
.import ground_vehicles.csv original

Look at the db schema and see what tables are there and what columns they have
.schema

Run some sql select statements to look at the data:
Select distinct “Vendor  Top Name” from original;

Select “Vendor  Top Name”, count(*)
from original
Group by 1
Having count(*) > 1000
Order by 2 desc; 

Exit from SQLite
.quit
